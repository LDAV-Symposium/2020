# Information for Presenters

## Paper Presentation

All papers (short and long) get 15 minutes for the talk and then 5 minutes
for questions and switching presenters. We have a full schedule this year â€“
please stay on time.

All presenters are encouraged to use the [LDAV slide template].
To gain maximum size and benefit on the screen, we suggest presenters
use the 16x9 wide format PowerPoint templates.

Additional information regarding the facility equipment is available
from the [IEEE VIS speaker information]. (Note that LDAV has a different
slide template and talk length than the main VIS conference.)
